I suggest they should arrange to run more buses in work timings so people don’t reach office and college late and in standing position."

30/12/2023 11:06,40,Female,Teacher,"Bus, Train","Work, Visit family / friends/entertainment/leisure",Really bad scarce timetables for the people poor connection and so so expensive 
30/12/2023 11:54,56,Female,Manager,"Bus, Luas","Work, Visit family / friends/entertainment/leisure, Personal business/other","the worst thing is when the bus is announced on several platforms (google, tpi and the bus itself) and the the bus just doesnt come!?!?!?!  the second is - you wave for the bus - he decides that he is driving tooo fast and cant stop. the bus drivers know their stops and anyway there is a limit of speeding.  or the bus driver decides that the bus is full. even though and will not let you enter, even though you see there are empty seats...Sometimes I think the bus driver are on some kind of drug... if there is a public event of any sort or concert or parade...the public transportation just shuts down. when on the contrary it should be shut down for cars...have people park their cars on a huge parking space for free or for 1 euro a day....and use the public transportation through the city...You can not rely on public bus transportation in Dublin. You have to be very careful about your timing. It should be the best in the city and if it were, so many people would use it. "
